# First Blog Post

This is an example blog post to demonstrate how the eleventy-plugin-llms-txt plugin handles blog posts and collections.

## What is this plugin?

The eleventy-plugin-llms-txt plugin generates a llms.txt file that includes all the content from your Eleventy site in a format that's easy for Large Language Models (LLMs) to consume.

## How does it work?

The plugin processes all your site's collections and generates a structured text file that includes:

1. Page metadata (title, URL, date, tags, etc.)
2. Page content (with HTML stripped)
3. Collection structure

This makes it easier for LLMs to understand and reference your site's content.
