# About This Site

This is an example site created to demonstrate the eleventy-plugin-llms-txt plugin.

## What is llms.txt?

The llms.txt file is a structured text file that contains the content of your website in a format that's optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and others.

## Why use llms.txt?

LLMs can better understand and reference your website's content when it's presented in a structured format. The llms.txt file provides:

1. **Structured content**: Organized by collections, pages, and metadata
2. **Clean text**: HTML stripped and whitespace normalized
3. **Relevant metadata**: Titles, URLs, dates, tags, and custom fields
4. **Efficient crawling**: All content in one file for easy processing

## How to use the plugin

Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/yourusername/eleventy-plugin-llms-txt) for more information on how to use the plugin in your own Eleventy site.
