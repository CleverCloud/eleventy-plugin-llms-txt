# First Blog Post

This is an example blog post to demonstrate how the eleventy-plugin-llms-txt plugin handles blog posts and collections in the advanced example.

## What is this plugin?

The eleventy-plugin-llms-txt plugin generates a llms.txt file that includes all the content from your Eleventy site in a format that's easy for Large Language Models (LLMs) to consume.

## Advanced Configuration

In this advanced example, we're using custom configuration options to:

1. Output the llms.txt file to a custom location (ai/llms.txt)
2. Only include specific collections (posts and pages)
3. Exclude certain collections (drafts)
4. Set a site URL for absolute links
5. Limit content length
6. Include additional metadata fields (description, author, category)

This demonstrates the flexibility of the plugin and how it can be customized to fit your specific needs.
